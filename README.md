Final Project: How to get angry
CS 5360 VR Project Summary

Team name: Jaithra Bhatia,
Release Date: 13th December				                                                    
Platform: Unreal Engine/Oculus/HTC
Website: Github

Pitch:
To come up with a way of experiencing human reaction similar to what a person might feel in real life. This has been mainly used in mental healthcare to help patients with relaxation with the use of VR. My idea for the project was to instead try to replicate scenarios which would cause someone stress in real-life and see if the same scenario could cause similar amounts of stress within VR.

History:
Before thinking of the idea for my project, I heard about how VR is being researched in being used in mental healthcare to help out and relax patients while they are either in hospitals or in mental healthcare facilities. I thought it would be nice to see how much of the real world VR is able to replicate and see if we can experience similar human reactions. This project was initially set out to create different real-life scenarios that would normally stress the user out and see if we can get similar reactions in VR. The final product turned out to be a game which is basically trying to stimulate the player by making them perform tasks that might deter them from the original goal. I went this route since it seemed to be more fun developing a mini game since I have experience in doing so for past projects I have worked on.

Features:
2.Actions that cause the user to deter from the original goal.
3.Having motion in or moving so the user can get the feeling of urgency to get to places.
4.Having a time indicator to limit the player to complete something within a time frame.
5.Having 2 or more different VR world environments to cause a shift in mood.
6. Having hand movement to pick up objects.
7. Text interaction between the players.


About:
I had worked solo on this project. I am a CS student with an emphasis in EAE. Since my Capstone project was going to be related to EAE with us building a game, I wanted to have more knowledge on software and hardware used for creating games and how they help create an immersive environment. I came across CS 5360 this class while discussing with my advisor and finding out that there is a relatively new VR class. Since Iâ€™ve been interested in VR for quite some while and seeing the development of products within this space, I wanted to gain some knowledge on how VR actually works. Also never have owned any VR product, when I went over the description and syllabus of the class it mentioned us creating our own VR headset and that got me interested as well.

Most of the assets used in the game were assets I found on the unreal engines assets marketplace. Apart from that, the game interactions were built by me.
